# Anomaly_detection_Astronomy_data
In this repo we will perfrom Anomaly detection on astronomy data. From kaggle dataset, build an architecture that will detect anomalies in the data. Classify outliers vs regular data.
# Data Downloading
We downloaded data from kaggle "Astronomy Image Classification Dataset"

# Feature Extraction 
   - Use CLIP or DINO for extracting embeddings (pretrained weights are available).
   - Fine-tune if necessary for domain-specific anomalies.

# Classification of anomaly
## With Isolation forest 
`python isolation_forest.py`

# WIth Auto Encoders 

# With ResNet + ViT + Isolation Forest
